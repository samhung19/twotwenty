 *               If invalid, the error message "make_guess: invalid guess\n" should be printed and 0 returned.
 *               For an invalid guess, the guess_number is not incremented.
 * INPUTS: guess_str -- a string consisting of the guess typed by the user
 * OUTPUTS: the following are only valid if the function returns 1 (A valid guess)

 * RETURN VALUE: 1 if the guess string is valid (the guess contains exactly four
 *               numbers between 1 and 8), or 0 if it is invalid
 * SIDE EFFECTS: prints (using printf) the number of matches found and increments guess_number(valid guess)
 *               or an error message (invalid guess)
 *               (NOTE: the output format MUST MATCH EXACTLY, check the wiki writeup)
